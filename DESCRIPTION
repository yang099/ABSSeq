Title: ABSSeq: a new RNA-Seq analysis method based on absolute
        expression differences and generalized Poisson model
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Wentao Yang
Maintainer: Wentao Yang <wyang@zoologie.uni-kiel.de>
Description: Inferring differential expression genes by absolute
        expression differences between two groups, utilizing
        generalized Poisson model to account for over-dispersion across
        samples and heterogeneity of differential expression across
        genes.
